To report security vulnerabilities, open a normal bug report in the
[calibre bug tracker](https://calibre-ebook.com/bugs) and mark it private.

Additionally, you can use GitHub Private security advisories against this
repository to report issues.

Note that I will respond to security communication within 72 hours. Once
the bug is confirmed, it will be fixed or at least mitigated within another 72
hours, at which time the fix will typically be committed to master and hence be
public. That timeline might be extended based on the severity of the issue and the
current state of master in terms of making a new release, if so, it will be
done in consultation with the issue reporter.

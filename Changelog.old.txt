- [major] A new book editor, capable of editing files in the EPUB and AZW3 (Kindle) formats

Right click on any book in calibre and choose 'Edit Book', to edit e-books in the EPUB and AZW3 formats.

To use this feature, click the button labeled 'Virtual Library' to the left of the search bar. For details, see https://manual.calibre-ebook.com/virtual_libraries.html. This feature used to be called 'Search restriction', the new virtual libraries are easier to use, but otherwise fulfil the same function.

To enable them go to Preferences->Metadata download and enable the 'Google Image' and 'Big Book Search' sources. Google Images is useful for finding larger covers as well as alternate versions of the cover. Big Book Search searches for alternate covers from amazon.com. It can occasionally find nicer covers than the direct Amazon source. Note that both these sources download multiple covers for a single book. Some of these covers can be wrong (i.e. they may be of a different book or not covers at all, so you should inspect the results and manually pick the best match). When bulk downloading, these sources are only used if the other sources find no covers.

- [major] New tool: "Polish books" that allows you to perform various automated cleanup actions on EPUB and AZW3 files without doing a full conversion.

Polishing books is all about putting the shine of perfection on your ebook files. You can use it to subset embedded fonts, update the metadata in the book files from the metadata in the calibre library, manipulate the book jacket, etc. More features will be added in the future. To use this tool, go to Preferences->Toolbar and add the Polish books tool to the main toolbar. Then simply select the books you want to be polished and click the Polish books button. Polishing, unlike conversion, does not change the internal structure/markup of your book, it performs only the minimal set of actions needed to achieve its goals. Note that polish books is a completely new codebase, so there may well be bugs, polishing a book backs up the original as ORIGINAL_EPUB or ORIGINAL_AZW3, unless you have turned off this feature in Preferences->Tweaks, in which case you should backup your files manually. You can also use this tool from the command line with ebook-polish.exe.

Subsetting a font means reducing the font to contain only the glyphs for the text actually present in the book.

Turn it on via the 'Subset all embedded fonts' option under the Look & Feel section of the conversion dialog. calibre can subset both TrueType and OpenType fonts. Note that this code is very new and likely has bugs, so please check the output if you turn on subsetting. The conversion log will have info about the subsetting operations.

So if your calibre interface language is set to English, n will match both n and ñ, but if it is set to Spanish, it will match only n, as in Spanish ñ is a separate alphabet in Spanish. This makes searching a little slower, so if you have a very large library you can turn it off via Preferences->Searching.

- [major] When doing a conversion from some format to the same format, save the original file

When calibre does a conversion from the same format to the same format, for example, from EPUB to EPUB, the original file is saved as original_epub, so that in case the conversion is poor, you can change the settings and run it again. The original is automatically used every time you run a conversion with that format as input. If you want to disable this, there is a tweak that prevents calibre from saving the originals in Preferences->Tweaks. You can easily replace the converted version with the original in the Edit metadata dialog by right clicking on the list of formats in the top right corner.

"calibre now automatically backups up the metadata for each book in the library into an individual OPF file in that books' folder. This means that if the calibre metadata database is corrupted, for example by a hard disk failure, you can reconstruct it from these OPF files, without losing any metadata. For the moment, only the backup is implemented, restore will be implemented in the future. The backup happens automatically in the background while calibre is running. The first time you start calibre, all the books will need to be backed up, so you may notice calibre running a little slower than usual."

{{{ 0.6.54 2010-05-21
:: new features

- [major] EPUB Output: Add option to toggle preserving the aspect ratio of the cover.

"By default calibre creates an SVG based cover that scales with the screen size of the reader used to view it. Previosuly this scaling was limited to preserve the aspect ratio of the image. This would often result in white borders at the sides or top and bottom of the image. No, by default, calibre will setup the cover to not preserve aspect ratio, doing away with the white borders. The downside is that if the aspect ratio of the cover is very different from the reader, it will look distorted. The old behavior can be restored via Preferences->Conversion->EPUB Output."


- [major] Conversion pipeline: calibre will now automatically replace all ligatures in the input document.

"Conversion pipeline: calibre will now automatically replace all ligatures in the input document with the normal character sequence they are meant to represent. This is because most readers lack the font support to display ligatures. This can be turned off via an option under Look & Feel, in the Conversion settings."

"You can now easily generate a catlog of all books in your calibre library by clicking the arrow next to the convert button. The catalog can be in one of several formats: XML, CSV, EPUB and MOBI, with scope for future formats via plugins.

- [major] Metadata download: Add two new sources for covers: Google Image Search and bigbooksearch.com.

To enable them go to Preferences->Metadata download and enable the 'Google Image' and 'Big Book Search' sources. Google Images is useful for finding larger covers as well as alternate versions of the cover. Big Book Search searches for alternate covers from amazon.com. It can occasionally find nicer covers than the direct Amazon source. Note that both these sources download multiple covers for a single book. Some of these covers can be wrong (i.e. they may be of a different book or not covers at all, so you should inspect the results and manually pick the best match). When bulk downloading, these sources are only used if the other sources find no covers.

- [major] New tool: "Polish books" that allows you to perform various automated cleanup actions on EPUB and AZW3 files without doing a full conversion.

Polishing books is all about putting the shine of perfection on your ebook files. You can use it to subset embedded fonts, update the metadata in the book files from the metadata in the calibre library, manipulate the book jacket, etc. More features will be added in the future. To use this tool, go to Preferences->Toolbar and add the Polish books tool to the main toolbar. Then simply select the books you want to be polished and click the Polish books button. Polishing, unlike conversion, does not change the internal structure/markup of your book, it performs only the minimal set of actions needed to achieve its goals. Note that polish books is a completely new codebase, so there may well be bugs, polishing a book backs up the original as ORIGINAL_EPUB or ORIGINAL_AZW3, unless you have turned off this feature in Preferences->Tweaks, in which case you should backup your files manually. You can also use this tool from the command line with ebook-polish.exe.

{{{ 0.9.6 2012-11-10

- [major] Experimental support for subsetting fonts

Subsetting a font means reducing the font to contain only the glyphs for the text actually present in the book. This can easily halve the size of the font. calibre can now do this for all embedded fonts during a conversion. Turn it on via the 'Subset all embedded fonts' option under the Look & Feel section of the conversion dialog. calibre can subset both TrueType and OpenType fonts. Note that this code is very new and likely has bugs, so please check the output if you turn on subsetting. The conversion log will have info about the subsetting operations.

- EPUB Input: Try to workaround EPUBs that have missing or damaged ZIP central directories. calibre should now be able to read/convert such an EPUB file, provided it does not suffer from further corruption.

Of course, whether the fonts actually show up on a reader will depend on the readers' support for CSS 3.

{{{ 0.8.60 2012-07-13

- [major] When searching, allow use of un-accented characters to match accented characters in all fields and all languages (not just authors and English as before)

The rules for matching un-accented characters are done in a language dependent way. So if your calibre interface language is set to English, n will match both n and Ã±, but if it is set to Spanish, it will match only n, as in Spanish Ã± is a separate alphabet in Spanish. This makes searching a little slower, so if you have a very large library you can turn it off via Preferences->Searching.

- [major] When doing a conversion from some format to the same format, save the original file

When calibre does a conversion from the same format to the same format, for example, from EPUB to EPUB, the original file is saved as original_epub, so that in case the conversion is poor, you can change the settings and run it again. The original is automatically used every time you run a conversion with that format as input. If you want to disable this, there is a tweak that prevents calibre from saving the originals in Preferences->Tweaks. You can easily replace the converted version with the original in the Edit metadata dialog by right clicking on the list of formats in the top right corner.

- [811641] Regex builder: Show a nicer error message when the user has the file open in another program on windows.

"These changes will allow calibre, in the future, to support book language, arbitrary book identifiers and keep track of when the metadata for a book was last modified. WARNING: Because of these changes, if you downgrade calibre versions after upgrading to 0.7.48, you will lose any changes you make to the ISBN of book entries in your calibre database, so do not downgrade unless you really have to. Also note that the first time you start calibre after this update, the startup will be slow as the database structure is being changed."

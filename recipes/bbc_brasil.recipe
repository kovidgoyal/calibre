    #  First select the feeds you want then scroll down below the feeds list
    #  and select the values you want for the other user preferences, like
    #  oldest_article and such like.
    #
    #
    #  Select the BBC rss feeds which you want in your ebook.
    #  Selected feed have NO '#' at their start, de-selected feeds begin with a '#'.

    #  Eg. #("News Home", "http://feeds.bbci.co.uk/... - do not include feed.
    #
    # There are 68 feeds below which constitute the bulk of the available rss
    # feeds on the BBC web site. These include 5 blogs by editors and
    # correspondants, 16 sports feeds, 15 'sub' regional feeds (Eg. North West
    # Wales, Scotland Business), and 7 Welsh language feeds.
    #
    # Some of the feeds are low volume (Eg. blogs), or very low volume (Eg. Click)
    # so if "oldest_article = 1.5" (only articles published in the last 36 hours)
    # you may get some 'empty feeds' which will not then be included in the ebook.
    #
    # The 15 feeds currently selected below are simply my default ones.
    #
    # Note: With all 68 feeds selected, oldest_article set to 2,
    # max_articles_per_feed set to 100, and simultaneous_downloads set to 10,
    # the ebook creation took 29 minutes on my speedy 100 mbps net connection,
    # fairly high-end desktop PC running Linux (Ubuntu Lucid-Lynx).
    # More realistically with 15 feeds selected, oldest_article set to 1.5,
    # max_articles_per_feed set to 100, and simultaneous_downloads set to 20,
    # it took 6 minutes. If that's too slow increase 'simultaneous_downloads'.

    # You may wish to extend this to 2-5 but watch out ebook creation time will

Palm Markup Language
--------------------

This page explains how to use the Palm Markup Language (PML) to specify
formatting and other information in a text file for later reading using the
eReader.

PML commands start with a backslash, "\", and usually consist of a single
character after that. Some PML commands are paired, such as those that specify
italicized text. Other commands are directives, such as the "\p", which
specifies a page break. PML is not meant to be an industrial-strength markup
language, but it is easy to understand, easy to parse, and creates high-quality
electronic books.

Since PML and Palm DropBook are not without flaws, there is a page of Tips and
Pitfalls.


Let's Dive Right In
-------------------

palmsample.txt contains examples of formatting text, specifying chapters, etc.
Use it to start from, or just as an example when making your own books.

The following table specifies the Palm Markup Language commands, and what
they do.

\p                              New page
\x                              New chapter; also causes a new page break.
                                Enclose chapter title (and any style codes)
                                with \x and \x
\Xn                             New chapter, indented n levels (n between 0 and
                                4 inclusive) in the Chapter dialog; doesn't
                                cause a page break. Enclose chapter title (and
                                any style codes) with \Xn and \Xn
\Cn="Chapter title"             Insert "Chapter title" into the chapter
                                listing, with level n (like \Xn). The text is
                                not shown on the page and does not force a page
                                break. This can sometimes be useful to insert a
                                chapter mark at the beginning of an
                                introduction to the chapter, for example.
\c                              Center this block of text; close with \c on
                                beginning of line
\r                              Right justify text block; close with \r on
                                beginning of line
\i                              Italicize block; close with \i
\u                              Underline block; close with \u
\o                              Overstrike block; close with \o
\v                              Invisible text; close with \v (can be used for
                                comments)
\t                              Indent block. Start at beginning of a line,
                                close with \t at end of a line
\T="50%"                        Indents the specified percentage of the screen
                                width, 50% in this case. If the current drawing
                                position is already past the specified screen
                                location, this tag is ignored.
\w="50%"                        Embed a horizontal rule of a given percentage
                                width of the screen, in this case 50%. This tag
                                causes a line break before and after it. The
                                rule is centered. The percent sign is mandatory.
\n                              Switch to the "normal" font, which is specified
                                by the user
\s                              Switch to stdFont; close with \s to revert to
                                normal font
\b                              Switch to boldFont; close with \b to revert to
                                normal font (deprecated; use \B instead)
\l                              Switch to largeFont; close with \l to revert to
                                normal font
\B                              Mark text as bold. Unlike the \b tag, \B
                                doesn't change the font, so you can have large
                                bold text. You cannot mix \b and \B in the same
                                PML file.
\Sp                             Mark text as superscript. Should not be mixed
                                with other styles such as bold, italic, etc.
                                Enclose superscripted text with \Sp.
\Sb                             Mark text as subscript. Should not be mixed
                                with other styles such as bold, italic, etc.
                                Enclose subscripted text with \Sb.
\k                              Make enclosed text into small-caps; close with
                                \k. Any characters enclosed in \k tags
                                (including those with accents) are made
                                uppercase and are rendered at a smaller point
                                size than a regular uppercase character.
\\                              Represents a single backslash
\aXXX                           Insert non-ASCII character whose Windows 1252
                                code is decimal XXX. See the PML character
                                table for details.
\UXXXX                          Insert non-ASCII character whose Unicode code
                                is hexadecimal XXXX. See the Extended PML
                                character table for details.
\m="imagename.png"              Insert the named image. See the section on
                                Images below.
\q="#linkanchor"Some text\q     Reference a link anchor which is at another
                                spot in the document. The string after the
                                anchor specification and before the trailing\q
                                is underlined or otherwise shown to be a link
                                when viewing the document.
\Q="linkanchor"                 Specify a link anchor in the document.
\-                              Insert a soft hyphen. A soft hyphen shows up
                                only if it is necessary to break a word across
                                a line.
\Fn="footnote1"1\Fn             Link the "1" to a footnote whose name is
                                footnote1, tagged at the end of the PML
                                document. See the section on Footnotes and
                                Sidebars below.
\Sd="sidebar1"Sidebar\Sd        Link the "Sidebar" text to a sidebar whose name
                                is sidebar1, tagged at the end of the PML
                                document. See the section on Footnotes and
                                Sidebars below.
\I                              Mark as a reference index item. Enclose index
                                item (and any style codes) with \I and \I. See
                                Creating Dictionaries for more information.

Footnotes and Sidebars
----------------------

Footnotes and Sidebars are specified with an XML-like syntax at the end of the
PML document. For example,

<sidebar id="sidebar1">
Here's some \itext\i for a sidebar.
</sidebar>

would specify the sidebar to be displayed when the user taps on a sidebar link
in the text that was specified using the \Sd tag.

Any text or PML placed after the first footnote or sidebar is ignored as part
of the book text.

Sidebars and footnotes can include most PML features, but there are some PML
tags that cannot be used inside of a sidebar or footnote.

These include
Chapters       \x, \X, \C
Links       \q, \Q
Footnotes           \Fn
Sidebars    \Sd

See the palmsample.txt file for examples of how to use many of the PML tags.


Images
------

The following rules are intended to guarantee that images in your eBook will be
viewable on all platforms that eReader runs on.

On low-resolution Palm OS handhelds, an image wider than 158 pixels or taller
than 148 pixels will be represented in the text by a thumbnail that the user
can tap to view the entire image. Images smaller than 158 x 148 will be
presented in-line with the text.

On high-resolution Palm OS handhelds (those having screens of 320x320 pixels or
more), images smaller than 158 by 148 pixels will be pixel-doubled. Images
larger than 158x148 may be shown in-line with the text, if they will fit on
the screen.

On non-Palm OS platforms, small images will be scaled up appropriately. Large
images will be scaled down to fit on the page; in this case the user can tap on
the image to view the entire image and zoom in or out.

For DropBook to find the image, it must be present in a directory whose name
matches that of the PML text file. For example, if "pmlsample.txt" contains a
reference to an image called "intro.png", then there must be a directory called
"pmlsample_img" that contains intro.png. The directory's name is the name of
the PML file (without the .txt extension) with "_img" appended.

Images must be in PNG format and cannot be filtered or interlaced. Image depth
must be 8 bits or less. Any color table may be used for color images.

Image files must be less than or equal to 65505 bytes in size, since they are
embedded into the .pdb format of the book; Palm database records are limited to
65505 bytes in length. Since images are compressed, the actual image displayed
by the reader may be much larger than 64K.

Any or all of these restrictions may eventually be removed.


Adding a Title, Cover Art, and Other Meta-information to Your eBook
-------------------------------------------------------------------

DropBook normally presents a dialog in which the title and other information
for the eBook may be specified. This information may be embedded in the PML
file instead.

To specify the eBook title as it will appear in the Open dialog on the
handheld, place a block of invisible comment text at the beginning of the file
using \v tags. Inside this comment block, put the string TITLE="My eBook",
where "My eBook" is replaced with the name of your eBook. It should look
something like this:

\vTITLE="Palm Sample Document"\v

You can also specify the author using the AUTHOR meta-tag, the publisher with
PUBLISHER, copyright information with COPYRIGHT, and the eBook ISBN with EISBN.
A fully-specified set of meta-information might appear in PML as:

\vTITLE="Palm Sample Document" AUTHOR="Sam Morgenstern" PUBLISHER="eReader.com"
EISBN="X-XXXX-XXXX" COPYRIGHT="Copyright \a169 2004 by Sam Morgenstern"\v

Cover art: If an image named "cover.png" is present in the eBook, it is assumed
to be the cover art for the eBook. See the rules for images for sizing and
other information.

Some or all of this information may appear in the book information dialog in
eReader, and may be used for other purposes in future products.


Creating Dictionaries
---------------------

The \I PML tag is used to delimit an index item. Example: \Iaardvark\I

Each entry must start in the normal font. If DropBook shows an error beginning
with "No styles permitted before...", there is probably a missing end style tag
before the text shown in the error message.

Links, chapters and other PML structures are not permitted in dictionaries.
Images, however, are.

A special dictionary entry, "(Front matter)" is shown before other entries in
the list of entries, and should be used to include pronunciation symbols and
other front matter.

Note that use of dictionaries requires eReader Pro.


Tips and Pitfalls
-----------------

This page explains some common mistakes, some bugs in DropBook and/or the
eReader, and some techniques that will allow you to create quality electronic
books for the eReader.

    * Check out the Converting to Palm eBooks page for some pointers on
      converting text from various formats into the Palm Markup Language.
    * Use a return at the end of each paragraph, not each line.
    * Using an extra return between paragraphs reads easier than paragraph
      indentation.
    * The eReader doesn't display empty lines at the top of a page. If you need
      to have some "empty" lines at the top of a page, put a space on each line.
    * Don't use tables if you can possibly avoid it.

      None of the fonts that the eReader supports are monospaced, so tables can
      be difficult to represent. Break out the information in another way, or
      use the \T tag, but beware of tables that look great on a Palm OS
      handheld but not on a Pocket PC or vice versa.

    * The Reader breaks lines on spaces, dashes or underscores. This has
      several implications.

         1. Don't fill more than a line with spaces, dashes or underscores.
            There's a bug (which will be fixed in a future release) which
            causes MakeBook to hang on such a line. Note that in the large
            font, the number of spaces, dashes or underscores will be much
            smaller than in the small font.
         2. A string such as He shouted "Wait!--" may place the last quote on
            the beginning of a line, since the line would break after the
            second dash. Prevent this by using the PML string: He shouted
            "Wait!\a150\a150". The non-breaking dash, code 150, will not break
            a line. Use \a160 for a non-breaking space. Even better: use \a151,
            a long dash, instead of two short dashes.

    * The justification codes \c and \r (center and right justification) must
      have closing codes on the beginning of the line following the justified
      text.
    * The indentation tag \t must have a closing tag at the end of a line of
      the indented text.
    * Use \s (small font) in the title page(s) of books to force the page(s) to
      format nicely. Other than that, \n, \s and \l should rarely be necessary;
      the font size used for most text display should be chosen by the user.


Converting Uncommon Characters to PML
-------------------------------------

Use this chart to convert uncommon characters to their Palm Markup Language
(PML) equivalent. Most characters are simply represented as themselves in PML
and don't require this chart. But some uncommon characters can only be
represented in PML by their "\aXXX" syntax. Use this chart to look up that
"\aXXX" syntax.

For Example, if you wanted to write the following phrase in PML:

    Copyright © 1999 by Samuel Morgenstern

In PML, you would write it as:

    Copyright \a169 1999 by Samuel Morgenstern

Extended Character Set
----------------------

In addition to the special characters supported by earlier versions of eReader
(which can be accessed using the \a### tag), all versions of eReader Pro and
eReader version 2.4 and later include support for additional special characters
and symbols. These symbols can be accessed using the \U#### tag, where #### are
four hexadecimal digits giving the Unicode encoding of the special character.

Only the limited subset of Unicode characters given in the table below are
supported. In addition, some of the characters that are included in the table
are not present in eReader Pro versions prior to 2.4. To ensure that the
characters are displayed correctly, books using these tags should be read using
eReader or eReader Pro version 2.4 or later.

On Palm OS handhelds these special symbols are only available in one size,
matching the "Small" font. For best results on Palm OS handhelds the \U tag
should only be used inside blocks set to the "Small" font by way of \s tags.
On Palm OS handhelds these special characters are not affected by the font tags
(\s, \l, \b and \n), the bold style tag (\B), or the small caps style tag (\k).

If the \U characters are not showing up correctly using eReader on your Windows
desktop or laptop this problem is a result of the fonts for eReader not being
installed properly. The solution is to go to the directory C:\Windows\Fonts\
and "double click" on each font that starts with "Maynard". This will open each
font and allow the system to register it. Close the windows that were opened a
result of the mouse clicks and the problem should be resolved.

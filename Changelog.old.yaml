      description: >
        "By default calibre creates an SVG based cover that scales with the screen size of the reader used to view it. Previosuly this scaling
        was limited to preserve the aspect ratio of the image. This would often result in white borders at the sides or top and bottom of the image.
        No, by default, calibre will setup the cover to not preserve aspect ratio, doing away with the white borders. The downside is that if the
        aspect ratio of the cover is very different from the reader, it will look distorted. The old behavior can be restored via 
        Preferences->Conversion->EPUB Output."

  bug fixes:
    - title: "Device drivers: Ignore files on the device when there is a file system/file name encoding error"
      description: > 
                   Sometimes, the presence of files on the e-book device that have special characters in the file name
                   would cause calibre to throw an error when scanning the device for books. Now, calibre will simply
                   ignore the files whose names it cannot decode.

    - title: Support downloading of social metadata (ratings/tags/reviews etc.)
      description: >
                calibre is now able to download social metadata like tags/rating/reviews etc.,
                in addition to normal metadata and covers. Currently it uses Amazon as the only
                source for social metadata, but the download system supports plugins for the
                addition of more sources in the future.

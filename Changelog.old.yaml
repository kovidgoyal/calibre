      type: major
      description: "Polishing books is all about putting the shine of perfection on your ebook files. You can use it to subset embedded fonts, update the metadata in the book files from the metadata in the calibre library, manipulate the book jacket, etc. More features will be added in the future. To use this tool, go to Preferences->Toolbar and add the Polish books tool to the main toolbar. Then simply select the books you want to be polished and click the Polish books button. Polishing, unlike conversion, does not change the internal structure/markup of your book, it performs only the minimal set of actions needed to achieve its goals. Note that polish books is a completely new codebase, so there may well be bugs, polishing a book backs up the original as ORIGINAL_EPUB or ORIGINAL_AZW3, unless you have turned off this feature in Preferences->Tweaks, in which case you should backup your files manually. You can also use this tool from the command line with ebook-polish.exe."

You will have to either mount the devices by hand before starting calibre, or stick with version 0.8.24 (the vulnerability in the mount helper is a privilege escalation, which is relatively harmless on the vast majority of single user systems)."

        "calibre now automatically backups up the metadata for each book in the library into an individual OPF file in that books' folder. This means that if the calibre metadata database is corrupted, for example by a hard disk failure, you can reconstruct it from these OPF files, without losing any metadata. For the moment, only the backup is implemented, restore will be implemented in the future. The backup happens automatically in the background while calibre is running. The first time you start calibre, all the books will need to be backed up, so you may notice calibre running a little slower than usual."

      description: >
        "By default calibre creates an SVG based cover that scales with the screen size of the reader used to view it. Previosuly this scaling
        was limited to preserve the aspect ratio of the image. This would often result in white borders at the sides or top and bottom of the image.
        No, by default, calibre will setup the cover to not preserve aspect ratio, doing away with the white borders. The downside is that if the
        aspect ratio of the cover is very different from the reader, it will look distorted. The old behavior can be restored via 
        Preferences->Conversion->EPUB Output."

  bug fixes:
    - title: "Device drivers: Ignore files on the device when there is a file system/file name encoding error"
      description: > 
                   Sometimes, the presence of files on the e-book device that have special characters in the file name
                   would cause calibre to throw an error when scanning the device for books. Now, calibre will simply
                   ignore the files whose names it cannot decode.

  new features:
    - title: Support downloading of social metadata (ratings/tags/reviews etc.)
      description: >
                calibre is now able to download social metadata like tags/rating/reviews etc.,
                in addition to normal metadata and covers. Currently it uses Amazon as the only
                source for social metadata, but the download system supports plugins for the
                addition of more sources in the future.

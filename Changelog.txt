- Various news recipes now have the ability to download past issues, accessible via the Advanced tab in the Schedule news dialog

:: bug fixes

- [major 2075128] ONLY if you use the calibre Content server, you should update calibre as soon as possible

  If you do not know what the Content server is, you do not use it, and
  these do not apply to you. If you have set a password to access the
  Content server that you have not shared with anyone, these do not
  affect you.

  A remote code execution bug in the Content server introduced in
  calibre version 6.9.0 (released on 2022-11-25) means that anyone with
  access to the server also has access to the rest of the computer the
  server is running on. If you are using a password to protect access to
  the server only people that know the password can gain access via the
  bug. Thanks to STAR Labs (https://starlabs.sg) for finding these
  vulnerabilities.

- [2075125] Content server: Fix path traversal vulnerability

  A bug in a feature introduced in calibre version 6.16.0 (released
  2023-04-20) means anyone with access to the server can also read non
  calibre related files on the computer running the server.

- [2075131] Content server: Fix SQL injection vulnerability

  A bug in a feature introduced in calibre version 6.10.0 (released
  2022-12-16) means anyone with access to the server can also read
  non-calibre SQLITE database files on the computer running the server.

- [2075130] Content server: Fix an XSS vulnerability in one endpoint

  Only relevant if you embed the calibre server within a larger server, it means
  attackers who can convince users to click on a specially crafted link, can run
  JavaScript code with the same origin as the larger server calibre is embedded in.

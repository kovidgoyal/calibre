Contains various tweaks that affect calibre behavior. Only edit this file if
you know what you are doing. If you delete this file, it will be recreated from
defaults.
'''

#: Auto increment series index
# The algorithm used to assign a book added to an existing series a series number.
# New series numbers assigned using this tweak are always integer values, except
# if a constant non-integer is specified.
# Possible values are:
# next - First available integer larger than the largest existing number
# first_free - First available integer larger than 0
# next_free - First available integer larger than the smallest existing number
# last_free - First available integer smaller than the largest existing number
#             Return largest existing + 1 if no free number is found
# const - Assign the number 1 always
# no_change - Do not change the series index
# a number - Assign that number always. The number is not in quotes. Note that
#            0.0 can be used here.
# Examples:
# series_index_auto_increment = 'next'
# series_index_auto_increment = 'next_free'
# series_index_auto_increment = 16.5
#
# Set the use_series_auto_increment_tweak_when_importing tweak to True to
# use the above values when importing/adding books. If this tweak is set to
# False (the default) then the series number will be set to 1 if it is not
# explicitly set during the import. If set to True, then the
# series index will be set according to the series_index_auto_increment setting.
# Note that the use_series_auto_increment_tweak_when_importing tweak is used
# only when a value is not provided during import. If the importing regular
# expression produces a value for series_index, or if you are reading metadata
# from books and the import plugin produces a value, than that value will
# be used irrespective of the setting of the tweak.
series_index_auto_increment = 'next'
use_series_auto_increment_tweak_when_importing = False

#: Add separator after completing an author name
# Should the completion separator be append
# to the end of the completed text to
# automatically begin a new completion operation
# for authors.
# Can be either True or False
authors_completer_append_separator = False

#: Author sort name algorithm
# The algorithm used to copy author to author_sort
# Possible values are:
#  invert: use "fn ln" -> "ln, fn"
#  copy  : copy author to author_sort without modification
#  comma : use 'copy' if there is a ',' in the name, otherwise use 'invert'
#  nocomma : "fn ln" -> "ln fn" (without the comma)
# When this tweak is changed, the author_sort values stored with each author
# must be recomputed by right-clicking on an author in the left-hand tags pane,
# selecting 'manage authors', and pressing 'Recalculate all author sort values'.
# The author name suffixes are words that are ignored when they occur at the
# end of an author name. The case of the suffix is ignored and trailing
# periods are automatically handled. The same is true for prefixes.
# The author name copy words are a set of words which if they occur in an
# author name cause the automatically generated author sort string to be
# identical to the author name. This means that the sort for a string like Acme
# Inc. will be Acme Inc. instead of Inc., Acme
author_sort_copy_method = 'comma'
author_name_suffixes = ('Jr', 'Sr', 'Inc', 'Ph.D', 'Phd',
                        'MD', 'M.D', 'I', 'II', 'III', 'IV',
                        'Junior', 'Senior')
author_name_prefixes = ('Mr', 'Mrs', 'Ms', 'Dr', 'Prof')
author_name_copywords = ('Corporation', 'Company', 'Co.', 'Agency', 'Council',
        'Committee', 'Inc.', 'Institute', 'Society', 'Club', 'Team')

#: Splitting multiple author names
# By default, calibre splits a string containing multiple author names on
# ampersands and the words "and" and "with". You can customize the splitting
# by changing the regular expression below. Strings are split on whatever the
# specified regular expression matches, in addition to ampersands.
# Default: r'(?i),?\s+(and|with)\s+'
authors_split_regex = r'(?i),?\s+(and|with)\s+'

#: Use author sort in Tag browser
# Set which author field to display in the tags pane (the list of authors,
# series, publishers etc on the left hand side). The choices are author and
# author_sort. This tweak affects only what is displayed under the authors
# category in the tags pane and Content server. Please note that if you set this
# to author_sort, it is very possible to see duplicate names in the list because
# although it is guaranteed that author names are unique, there is no such
# guarantee for author_sort values. Showing duplicates won't break anything, but
# it could lead to some confusion. When using 'author_sort', the tooltip will
# show the author's name.
# Examples:
#   categories_use_field_for_author_name = 'author'
#   categories_use_field_for_author_name = 'author_sort'
categories_use_field_for_author_name = 'author'

#: Control partitioning of Tag browser
# When partitioning the tags browser, the format of the subcategory label is
# controlled by a template: categories_collapsed_name_template if sorting by
# name, categories_collapsed_rating_template if sorting by average rating, and
# categories_collapsed_popularity_template if sorting by popularity. There are
# two variables available to the template: first and last. The variable 'first'
# is the initial item in the subcategory, and the variable 'last' is the final
# item in the subcategory. Both variables are 'objects'; they each have multiple
# values that are obtained by using a suffix. For example, first.name for an
# author category will be the name of the author. The sub-values available are:
#  name: the printable name of the item
#  count: the number of books that references this item
#  avg_rating: the average rating of all the books referencing this item
#  sort: the sort value. For authors, this is the author_sort for that author
#  category: the category (e.g., authors, series) that the item is in.
# Note that the "r'" in front of the { is necessary if there are backslashes
# (\ characters) in the template. It doesn't hurt anything to leave it there
# even if there aren't any backslashes.
categories_collapsed_name_template = r'{first.sort:shorten(4,,0)} - {last.sort:shorten(4,,0)}'
categories_collapsed_rating_template = r'{first.avg_rating:4.2f:ifempty(0)} - {last.avg_rating:4.2f:ifempty(0)}'
categories_collapsed_popularity_template = r'{first.count:d} - {last.count:d}'

#: Control order of categories in the Tag browser
# Change the following dict to change the order that categories are displayed in
# the Tag browser. Items are named using their lookup name, and will be sorted
# using the number supplied. The lookup name '*' stands for all names that
# otherwise do not appear. Two names with the same value will be sorted
# using the default order; the one used when the dict is empty.
# Example: tag_browser_category_order = {'series':1, 'tags':2, '*':3}
# resulting in the order series, tags, then everything else in default order.
tag_browser_category_order = {'*':1}


#: Specify columns to sort the booklist by on startup
# Provide a set of columns to be sorted on when calibre starts
#  The argument is None if saved sort history is to be used
#  otherwise it is a list of column,order pairs. Column is the
#  lookup/search name, found using the tooltip for the column
#  Order is 0 for ascending, 1 for descending
# For example, set it to [('authors',0),('title',0)] to sort by
# title within authors.
sort_columns_at_startup = None

#: Control how dates are displayed
# Format to be used for publication date and the timestamp (date).
#  A string controlling how the publication date is displayed in the GUI
#  d     the day as number without a leading zero (1 to 31)
#  dd    the day as number with a leading zero (01 to 31)
#  ddd   the abbreviated localized day name (e.g. 'Mon' to 'Sun').
#  dddd  the long localized day name (e.g. 'Monday' to 'Sunday').
#  M     the month as number without a leading zero (1-12)
#  MM    the month as number with a leading zero (01-12)
#  MMM   the abbreviated localized month name (e.g. 'Jan' to 'Dec').
#  MMMM  the long localized month name (e.g. 'January' to 'December').
#  yy    the year as two digit number (00-99)
#  yyyy  the year as four digit number
#  h     the hours without a leading 0 (0 to 11 or 0 to 23, depending on am/pm) '
#  hh    the hours with a leading 0 (00 to 11 or 00 to 23, depending on am/pm) '
#  m     the minutes without a leading 0 (0 to 59) '
#  mm    the minutes with a leading 0 (00 to 59) '
#  s     the seconds without a leading 0 (0 to 59) '
#  ss    the seconds with a leading 0 (00 to 59) '
#  ap    use a 12-hour clock instead of a 24-hour clock, with "ap"
#        replaced by the localized string for am or pm '
#  AP    use a 12-hour clock instead of a 24-hour clock, with "AP"
#        replaced by the localized string for AM or PM '
#  iso   the date with time and timezone. Must be the only format present
#  For example, given the date of 9 Jan 2010, the following formats show
#  MMM yyyy ==> Jan 2010    yyyy ==> 2010       dd MMM yyyy ==> 09 Jan 2010
#  MM/yyyy ==> 01/2010      d/M/yy ==> 9/1/10   yy ==> 10
# publication default if not set: MMM yyyy
# timestamp default if not set: dd MMM yyyy
# last_modified_display_format if not set: dd MMM yyyy
gui_pubdate_display_format = 'MMM yyyy'
gui_timestamp_display_format = 'dd MMM yyyy'
gui_last_modified_display_format = 'dd MMM yyyy'

#: Control sorting of titles and series in the library display
# Control title and series sorting in the library view. If set to
# 'library_order', the title sort field will be used instead of the title.
# Unless you have manually edited the title sort field, leading articles such as
# The and A will be ignored. If set to 'strictly_alphabetic', the titles will be
# sorted as-is (sort by title instead of title sort). For example, with
# library_order, The Client will sort under 'C'. With strictly_alphabetic, the
# book will sort under 'T'.
# This flag affects calibre's library display. It has no effect on devices. In
# addition, titles for books added before changing the flag will retain their
# order until the title is edited. Double-clicking on a title and hitting return
# without changing anything is sufficient to change the sort.
title_series_sorting = 'library_order'

#: Control formatting of title and series when used in templates
# Control how title and series names are formatted when saving to disk/sending
# to device. The behavior depends on the field being processed. If processing
# title, then if this tweak is set to 'library_order', the title will be
# replaced with title_sort. If it is set to 'strictly_alphabetic', then the
# title will not be changed. If processing series, then if set to
# 'library_order', articles such as 'The' and 'An' will be moved to the end. If
# set to 'strictly_alphabetic', the series will be sent without change.
# For example, if the tweak is set to library_order, "The Lord of the Rings"
# will become "Lord of the Rings, The". If the tweak is set to
# strictly_alphabetic, it would remain "The Lord of the Rings". Note that the
# formatter function raw_field will return the base value for title and
# series regardless of the setting of this tweak.
save_template_title_series_sorting = 'library_order'

#: Set the list of words considered to be "articles" for sort strings
# Set the list of words that are to be considered 'articles' when computing the
# title sort strings. The articles differ by language. By default, calibre uses
# a combination of articles from English and whatever language the calibre user
# interface is set to. In addition, in some contexts where the book language is
# available, the language of the book is used. You can change the list of
# articles for a given language or add a new language by editing
# per_language_title_sort_articles. To tell calibre to use a language other
# than the user interface language, set, default_language_for_title_sort. For
# example, to use German, set it to 'deu'. A value of None means the user
# interface language is used. The setting title_sort_articles is ignored
# (present only for legacy reasons).

#: Specify a folder calibre should connect to at startup
# Specify a folder that calibre should connect to at startup using
# connect_to_folder. This must be a full path to the folder. If the folder does
# not exist when calibre starts, it is ignored. If there are '\' characters in
# the path (such as in Windows paths), you must double them.
# Examples:
#     auto_connect_to_folder = 'C:\\Users\\someone\\Desktop\\testlib'
#     auto_connect_to_folder = '/home/dropbox/My Dropbox/someone/library'
auto_connect_to_folder = ''

#: Specify renaming rules for SONY collections
# Specify renaming rules for sony collections. This tweak is only applicable if
# metadata management is set to automatic. Collections on Sonys are named
# depending upon whether the field is standard or custom. A collection derived
# from a standard field is named for the value in that field. For example, if
# the standard 'series' column contains the value 'Darkover', then the
# collection name is 'Darkover'. A collection derived from a custom field will
# have the name of the field added to the value. For example, if a custom series
# column named 'My Series' contains the name 'Darkover', then the collection
# will by default be named 'Darkover (My Series)'. For purposes of this
# documentation, 'Darkover' is called the value and 'My Series' is called the
# category. If two books have fields that generate the same collection name,
# then both books will be in that collection.
# This set of tweaks lets you specify for a standard or custom field how
# the collections are to be named. You can use it to add a description to a
# standard field, for example 'Foo (Tag)' instead of the 'Foo'. You can also use
# it to force multiple fields to end up in the same collection. For example, you
# could force the values in 'series', '#my_series_1', and '#my_series_2' to
# appear in collections named 'some_value (Series)', thereby merging all of the
# fields into one set of collections.
# There are two related tweaks. The first determines the category name to use
# for a metadata field.  The second is a template, used to determines how the
# value and category are combined to create the collection name.
# The syntax of the first tweak, sony_collection_renaming_rules, is:
# {'field_lookup_name':'category_name_to_use', 'lookup_name':'name', ...}
# The second tweak, sony_collection_name_template, is a template. It uses the
# same template language as plugboards and save templates. This tweak controls
# how the value and category are combined together to make the collection name.
# The only two fields available are {category} and {value}. The {value} field is
# never empty. The {category} field can be empty. The default is to put the
# value first, then the category enclosed in parentheses, it isn't empty:
# '{value} {category:|(|)}'
# Examples: The first three examples assume that the second tweak
# has not been changed.
# 1: I want three series columns to be merged into one set of collections. The
# column lookup names are 'series', '#series_1' and '#series_2'. I want nothing
# in the parenthesis. The value to use in the tweak value would be:
#    sony_collection_renaming_rules={'series':'', '#series_1':'', '#series_2':''}
# 2: I want the word '(Series)' to appear on collections made from series, and
# the word '(Tag)' to appear on collections made from tags. Use:
#    sony_collection_renaming_rules={'series':'Series', 'tags':'Tag'}
# 3: I want 'series' and '#myseries' to be merged, and for the collection name
# to have '(Series)' appended. The renaming rule is:
#    sony_collection_renaming_rules={'series':'Series', '#myseries':'Series'}
# 4: Same as example 2, but instead of having the category name in parentheses
# and appended to the value, I want it prepended and separated by a colon, such
# as in Series: Darkover. I must change the template used to format the category name
# The resulting two tweaks are:
#    sony_collection_renaming_rules={'series':'Series', 'tags':'Tag'}
#    sony_collection_name_template='{category:||: }{value}'
sony_collection_renaming_rules={}
sony_collection_name_template='{value}{category:| (|)}'

#: Specify how SONY collections are sorted
# Specify how sony collections are sorted. This tweak is only applicable if
# metadata management is set to automatic. You can indicate which metadata is to
# be used to sort on a collection-by-collection basis. The format of the tweak
# is a list of metadata fields from which collections are made, followed by the
# name of the metadata field containing the sort value.
# Example: The following indicates that collections built from pubdate and tags
# are to be sorted by the value in the custom column '#mydate', that collections
# built from 'series' are to be sorted by 'series_index', and that all other
# collections are to be sorted by title. If a collection metadata field is not
# named, then if it is a series- based collection it is sorted by series order,
# otherwise it is sorted by title order.
# [(['pubdate', 'tags'],'#mydate'), (['series'],'series_index'), (['*'], 'title')]
# Note that the bracketing and parentheses are required. The syntax is

#: Compile general program mode templates to Python
# Compiled general program mode templates are significantly faster than
# interpreted templates. Setting this tweak to True causes calibre to compile
# (in most cases) general program mode templates. Setting it to False causes
# calibre to use the old behavior -- interpreting the templates. Set the tweak
# to False if some compiled templates produce incorrect values.
# Default:    compile_gpm_templates = True
# No compile: compile_gpm_templates = False
compile_gpm_templates = True

#: What format to default to when using the "Unpack book" feature
# The "Unpack book" feature of calibre allows direct editing of a book format.
# If multiple formats are available, calibre will offer you a choice
# of formats, defaulting to your preferred output format if it is available.
# Set this tweak to a specific value of 'EPUB' or 'AZW3' to always default
# to that format rather than your output format preference.
# Set to a value of 'remember' to use whichever format you chose last time you
# used the "Unpack book" feature.
# Examples:
#   default_tweak_format = None       (Use output format)
#   default_tweak_format = 'EPUB'
#   default_tweak_format = 'remember'
default_tweak_format = None

#: Do not preselect a completion when editing authors/tags/series/etc.
# This means that you can make changes and press Enter and your changes will
# not be overwritten by a matching completion. However, if you wish to use the
# completions you will now have to press Tab to select one before pressing
# Enter. Which technique you prefer will depend on the state of metadata in
# your library and your personal editing style.
preselect_first_completion = False

#: Completion mode when editing authors/tags/series/etc.
# By default, when completing items, calibre will show you all the candidates
# that start with the text you have already typed. You can instead have it show
# all candidates that contain the text you have already typed. To do this, set
# completion_mode to 'contains'. For example, if you type asi it will match both
# Asimov and Quasimodo, whereas the default behavior would match only Asimov.
completion_mode = 'prefix'

#: Recognize numbers inside text when sorting
# This means that when sorting on text fields like title the text "Book 2"
# will sort before the text "Book 100". If you want this behavior, set
# numeric_collation = True note that doing so will cause problems with text
# that starts with numbers and is a little slower.

#: Sort the list of libraries alphabetically
# The list of libraries in the Copy to Library and Quick Switch menus are
# normally sorted by most used. However, if there are more than a certain
# number of such libraries, the sorting becomes alphabetic. You can set that
# number here. The default is ten libraries.

#: Highlight the virtual library name when using a Virtual library
# The virtual library name next to the Virtual library button is highlighted in
# yellow when using a Virtual library. You can choose the color used for the
# highlight with this tweak. Set it to 'transparent' to disable highlighting.
highlight_virtual_library = 'yellow'

#: Choose available output formats for conversion
# Restrict the list of available output formats in the conversion dialogs.
# For example, if you only want to convert to EPUB and AZW3, change this to
# restrict_output_formats = ['EPUB', 'AZW3']. The default value of None causes
# all available output formats to be present.
restrict_output_formats = None

#: Set the thumbnail image quality used by the Content server
# The quality of a thumbnail is largely controlled by the compression quality
# used when creating it. Set this to a larger number to improve the quality.
# Note that the thumbnails get much larger with larger compression quality
# numbers.
# The value can be between 50 and 99

#: Image file types to treat as e-books when dropping onto the "Book details" panel
# Normally, if you drop any image file in a format known to calibre onto the
# "Book details" panel, it will be used to set the cover. If you want to store
# some image types as e-books instead, you can set this tweak.
# Examples:
#    cover_drop_exclude = {'tiff', 'webp'}

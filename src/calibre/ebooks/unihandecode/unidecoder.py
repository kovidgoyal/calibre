'''
Decode unicode text to an ASCII representation of the text in Chinese.
Transliterate unicode characters to ASCII based on chinese pronounce.

Derived from John Schember's unidecode library. Which was created
as part of calibre.

Copyright(c) 2009, John Schember <john@nachtimwald.com>

Based on the ruby unidecode gem (http://rubyforge.org/projects/unidecode/) which
is based on the perl module Text::Unidecode
(http://search.cpan.org/~sburke/Text-Unidecode-0.04/). More information about
unidecode can be found at
http://interglacial.com/~sburke/tpj/as_html/tpj22.html.

The major differences between this implementation and others is it's written in
python and it uses a single dictionary instead of loading the code group files
as needed.

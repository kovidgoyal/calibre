"""
Python-Markdown Extra Extension
===============================

A compilation of various Python-Markdown extensions that imitates
[PHP Markdown Extra](http://michelf.com/projects/php-markdown/extra/).

Note that each of the individual extensions still need to be available
on your PYTHONPATH. This extension simply wraps them all up as a 
convenience so that only one extension needs to be listed when
initiating Markdown. See the documentation for each individual
extension for specifics about that extension.

In the event that one or more of the supported extensions are not 
available for import, Markdown will issue a warning and simply continue 
without that extension. 

There may be additional extensions that are distributed with 
Python-Markdown that are not included here in Extra. Those extensions
are not part of PHP Markdown Extra, and therefore, not part of
Python-Markdown Extra. If you really would like Extra to include
additional extensions, we suggest creating your own clone of Extra
under a differant name. You could also edit the `extensions` global 
variable defined below, but be aware that such changes may be lost 
when you upgrade to any future version of Python-Markdown.

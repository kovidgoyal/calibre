class InterfaceAction(QObject):

    '''
    A plugin representing an "action" that can be taken in the graphical user
    interface. All the items in the toolbar and context menus are implemented
    by these plugins.

    Note that this class is the base class for these plugins, however, to
    integrate the plugin with calibre's plugin system, you have to make a
    wrapper class that references the actual plugin. See the
    :mod:`calibre.customize.builtins` module for examples.

    If two :class:`InterfaceAction` objects have the same name, the one with higher
    priority takes precedence.

    Sub-classes should implement the :meth:`genesis`, :meth:`library_changed`,
    :meth:`location_selected` :meth:`shutting_down`
    and :meth:`initialization_complete` methods.

    Once initialized, this plugin has access to the main calibre GUI via the
    :attr:`gui` member. You can access other plugins by name, for example::

        self.gui.iactions['Save To Disk']

    To access the actual plugin, use the :attr:`interface_action_base_plugin`
    attribute, this attribute only becomes available after the plugin has been
    initialized. Useful if you want to use methods from the plugin class like
    do_user_config().

    The QAction specified by :attr:`action_spec` is automatically create and
    made available as ``self.qaction``.

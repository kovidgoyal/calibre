   chm - A package to manipulate CHM files

   The chm package provides four modules: chm, chmlib, extra and
   _chmlib. _chmlib and chmlib are very low level libraries generated
   from  SWIG interface files, and are simple wrappers around the API
   defined by the C library chmlib.
   The extra module adds full-text search support.
   the chm module provides some higher level classes to simplify
   access to the CHM files information.

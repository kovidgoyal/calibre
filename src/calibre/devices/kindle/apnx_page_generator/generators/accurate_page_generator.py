        A more accurate but much more resource intensive and slower
        method to calculate the page length.

        Parses the uncompressed text. In an average paper back book
        There are 32 lines per page and a maximum of 70 characters
        per line.

        Each paragraph starts a new line and every 70 characters
        (minus markup) in a paragraph starts a new line. The
        position after every 30 lines will be marked as a new
        page.

        This can be make more accurate by accounting for
        <div class="mbp_pagebreak" /> as a new page marker.
        And <br> elements as an empty line.

Google Images is useful for finding larger covers as well as alternate versions of the cover. Big Book Search searches for alternate covers from amazon.com. It can occasionally find nicer covers than the direct Amazon source. Note that both these sources download multiple covers for a single book. Some of these covers can be wrong (i.e. they may be of a different book or not covers at all, so you should inspect the results and manually pick the best match). When bulk downloading, these sources are only used if the other sources find no covers."

  new features:
    - title: "New tool: \"Polish books\" that allows you to perform various automated cleanup actions on EPUB and AZW3 files without doing a full conversion."
      type: major
      description: "Polishing books is all about putting the shine of perfection on your ebook files. You can use it to subset embedded fonts, update the metadata in the book files from the metadata in the calibre library, manipulate the book jacket, etc. More features will be added in the future. To use this tool, go to Preferences->Toolbar and add the Polish books tool to the main toolbar. Then simply select the books you want to be polished and click the Polish books button. Polishing, unlike conversion, does not change the internal structure/markup of your book, it performs only the minimal set of actions needed to achieve its goals. Note that polish books is a completely new codebase, so there may well be bugs, polishing a book backs up the original as ORIGINAL_EPUB or ORIGINAL_AZW3, unless you have turned off this feature in Preferences->Tweaks, in which case you should backup your files manually. You can also use this tool from the command line with ebook-polish.exe."

Turn it on via the 'Subset all embedded fonts' option under the Look & Feel section of the conversion dialog. calibre can subset both TrueType and OpenType fonts.

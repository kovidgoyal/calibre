      type: major
      description: "Right click on any book in calibre and choose 'Edit Book', to edit e-books in the EPUB and AZW3 formats. The new editor allows you to edit the HTML/CSS and images inside the ebooks in a seamless fashion, with live preview of your changes and many helpful automated tools for checking the book for errors, editing the table of contents, merging, splitting, bulk renaming and so on. See http://manual.calibre-ebook.com/edit.html for more details and help using the new editor. Note that the editor is a completely new codebase and is still being actively developed, so expect a few bugs and many new features in the near future. However, the editor as it stands is extremely useable and useful today. Note that it replaces the old 'Tweak Book' feature in calibre. If you want the old Tweak Book back, it has been renamed to 'Unpack Book', you can go to Preferences->Toolbars and add it back. Happy holidays!"

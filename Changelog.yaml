    - title: "Automatic backup of the calibre metadata database"
      type: major
      desc: >
        "calibre now automatically backups up the metadata for each book in the library into an individual OPF file in that books' folder. This means that if the calibre metadata database is corrupted, for example by a hard disk failure, you can reconstruct it from these OPF files, without losing any metadata. For the moment, only the backup is implemented, restore will be implemented in the future. The backup happens automatically in the background while calibre is running. The first time you start calibre, all the books will need to be backed up, so you may notice calibre running a little slower than usual."

        "By default calibre creates an SVG based cover that scales with the screen size of the reader used to view it. Previosuly this scaling
        was limited to preserve the aspect ratio of the image. This would often result in white borders at the sides or top and bottom of the image.
        No, by default, calibre will setup the cover to not preserve aspect ratio, doing away with the white borders. The downside is that if the
        aspect ratio of the cover is very different from the reader, it will look distorted. The old behavior can be restored via 
        Preferences->Conversion->EPUB Output."

    - title: "Device drivers: Ignore files on the device when there is a file system/file name encoding error"
      description: > 
                   Sometimes, the presence of files on the e-book device that have special characters in the file name
                   would cause calibre to throw an error when scanning the device for books. Now, calibre will simply
                   ignore the files whose names it cannot decode.

      description: >
                calibre is now able to download social metadata like tags/rating/reviews etc.,
                in addition to normal metadata and covers. Currently it uses Amazon as the only
                source for social metadata, but the download system supports plugins for the
                addition of more sources in the future.
